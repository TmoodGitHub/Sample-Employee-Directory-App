Before I began this assessment, I did some researches on how other people may have built their project. The purpose of the research is to get a better idea of best practices, common methods, etc. During that research, I noticed that React.Component were less common now with more current approach to building React App. So I adopted similar method.

Next was determing which is better, Fetch or Axios API - it appear that Axios API is more favored over Fetch API when workign with React. I've also observed that it was possible to create an API component and then pass the data accordingly. As much as I was able to progress with this project, I was still stuck on the concept of passing the data.

Instead, I opted to have the API called separate with two pages created. The first page showing a traditional table list and used react-table library to help build the table. It was quite customizable and I was able to check off many of the features which includes searching, sorting and pagination. The second page was using card layout where I used tradition Bootstrap (as opposed to react-bootstrap). Since no additional library was used to build the card layout, I had to use a different apprach to searching. I did not implement sorting or pagination for card layout.

I hope my work demonstrated my skills as a web developer and also demonstrated the potentials to grow professionally. Please let me know what I could have done better and how I could have done better for I always appreciate constructive feedback to help me grow further. Thank you for your time and consideration!
